<p>
	Does your child like to solve problems? They might be interested in coding, and it's never too early or too late to start! The computer science industry is rapidly growing, and learning to code at a young age gives your child an edge in an increasingly competitive workforce. Coding also fosters incredible creativity and builds up critical thinking ability, both important life skills to have. We know parents always want what's best for their kids, so here are some resources to start your child off on their coding adventure. These are all great sites designed to make learning a blast instead of a bore!
