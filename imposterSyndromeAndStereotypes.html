<h1>Stereotyping and Imposter Syndrome</h1>
<P>When imagining a computer programmer, who do you think of? Chances are, it's not a woman. It wasn't until less than a century ago that women really began to integrate into the work force, so it's not a surprise that they are behind. However, while women have advanced in many fields, the U.S. Department of Education reports that the percentage of women receiving CS degrees is the smallest among all STEM fields.

According to a study from Accenture and Girls Who Code, in 1984, 37 percent of computer science majors were women, but the number had dropped to 18 percent by 2014. Computer science related jobs are rapidly increasing, yet, if trends continue, women are only going to hold 20% of those jobs by 2025. This disparity of gender in the computer programming is disheartening, and can dissuade young girls from pursuing the career path. Even after deciding to go into the industry, gender sterotypes in the work industry continue to cause problems for women.

Have you ever felt like everyone around you is smarter, more qualified, and has it better figured out than you? Do you ever feel like you have no idea what you're doing and that you're a fraud? Especially in computer science, a relatively new field that continues to develop daily, it is easy to get lost in the sea of changes, and feel inadequete compared to the brilliant minds out there. For women, the status quo of male programmers can additionally foster an internalized self-doubt that snowballs into a feeling of not being good enough for the job. This phenomenon is named imposter syndrome, because it makes you feel as if you're an imposter on the edge of being found out. If you feel this way, don't worry! It's a common feeling, though not a pleasant one. Thankfully, there are ways to combat imposter syndrome. Stop comparing yourself to others, recognize your accomplishments, realize that no one knows what they're doing, and talk about your experiences with others. Check out our forum to chat with other women in CS who are going through the same thing you are!
