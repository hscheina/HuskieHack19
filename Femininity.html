	<h1>Femininity</h1>
	<p>As men still make up the majority of the STEM branch, the culture of masculinity is strong, but where does that leave the women? For many women in the industry, being strong and powerful means having to give up their feminity. Otherwise, they risk not being taken seriously. </p>

	<p>Femininity being superficial and silly is a trope that has constantly been pereptuated by media and society. "Girl things" are generally viewed as less important than "boy things", and that idea follows women around for the rest of their life. We need to take control of the narrative and realize that femininity is not something we should try to supress, but instead, a part of ourselves we should embrace. </p>
