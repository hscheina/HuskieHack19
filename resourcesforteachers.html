	<h1>Teacher Resources</h1>
<p>
	It's a teacher's job to prepare kids for the real world, and the one thing school curriculums are the most lacking in is computer programming. After all, the world is becoming more and more technology-based, and kids need to be able to adapt to the new environment. 
</p><p>
	According to Code.org, high school students perform the same regardless of the teacher's previous CS experience. However it can still be a very daunting task to teach a complicated subject you may not be an expert at. Fortunately, there are many resources that are available to guide a curriculum and teach kids how to code!

    <h5 class="card-title">Code.org</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Code.org is a nonprofit dedicated to bringing computer science to all schools, and has done so with their Hour Of Code program campaign that has worked with 15% of all students globally. The site offers free computer science courses-including a popular one for AP Computer Science Principles-and allows kids to create fun coding projects, with material for all ages, even young kids aged 4-6.</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">Tynker</h5>
    <p class="card-text">This is the perfect tool for younger students K-8. Tynker is unique in that it applies computer programming to other subjects, such as math and english, so it is a good supplement to the core subjects. The courses meet Common Core Math and ELS standards, along with CSTA Computer Science standards. </p>
    <a href="https://www.tynker.com/free-classroom-school/coding-curriculum" class="btn btn-primary">Look into it!</a>

    <h5 class="card-title">Khan Academy</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Khan Academy is likely a site kids are familiar in and comfortable navigating, as it offers many math and science lessons. However, its programming course is unlike the math videos we are all used to, as they have built a well-designed and comphrehensive program that includes "talk-throughs"(interactive videos), coding challenges, and projects that can be viewed by peers. This 15-40 hour course teaches the fundamentals of programming as well as exploring HTML and Javascript, perfect for beginners!</p>
