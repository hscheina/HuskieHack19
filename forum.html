  <h2>Imposter Syndrome???</h2>
  <p class="quote">
   I've had this feeling my entire life but I didn't know it had a real name until I saw a flyer my college had made about it. If you don't know what it is, imposter syndrome is the feeling of not being good enough, and constantly worrying that everyone else is going to find out about your incompetance. Even though my accomplishments don't say it, my brain is constantly telling me that everyone else is so much ahead of me and I'm perpetually behind.   
  </p>
  <p>
    I feel like this might be happening because of two main things. First of all, the industry adds new feautures and concepts constantly, so it's pretty much impossible to be an expert at everything. Also, most of my coworkers are men and even though I try not to let it bother me, sometimes its hard when it seems like computer science is a man's game. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Does anyone else feel this way? I'd like to know I'm not just going crazy, please reach out!!

  <h2>What Can I Do After the AP Test?</h2>
  <p class="quote">
   Hey guys! I'm a high school junior and I am taking AP Computer Science A right now! At first, I only took it because my parents forced me to, but I ended up really enjoying the class. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I found myself looking forward to that class everyday, but that's the highest computer science class my school offers, so I'm not sure what to do with my newfound passion. I figured you guys would have some suggestions on what I can do to learn more about programming. What languages should I learn?
